# VANITY backend

> Backend for the [Vanity](https://github.com/Meeshkan/vanity) project.

## Development

Start the backend development server:

```
~/vanity ❯❯❯ cd backend/
~/v/backend ❯❯❯ npm install
~/v/backend ❯❯❯ npm run dev -p 3000
```

You can then access the backend service by navigating to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Component development

We use [storybook](https://storybook.js.org) for component development (in this case, for the email templates). To get started, run:

```
~/v/backend ❯❯❯ npm run storybook
```
